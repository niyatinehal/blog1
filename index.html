        <h1> Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that web developers commonly use to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games. </p>
        <p>
         HTML and CSS are used to design the skeleton of the application, but JavaScript makes it dynamic.   
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand it more clearly, let's compare a web application with a human body. Like in the human body there is a skeleton, muscle, and nervous system, similarly, in a web application, there is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML works as a skeleton, the CSS as the muscular system, and JavaScript as the nervous system.

        <h2>Basic commands and functions of JavaScript.</h2>

        <h3>1. var and const</h3>

        <p><strong>var</strong> and <strong> const </strong> both are used to declare javascript variables. The difference is just that var is for a normal variable declaration whose value can be changed, whereas a variable value declared using the const keyword cannot be changed.</p>
        
        <h3>2. alert and prompt</h3>
        <p><strong>Alert</strong>: An alert is a popup that has a notice within it.</p>

           <p><strong>Prompt</strong>: A prompt has an input field and expects the user to interact with it by entering some data.</p>

        <h3>3. Console.log()</h3>
        <p>The <strong>console.log()</strong> is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.</p>
