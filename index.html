        <h1> Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that web developers commonly use to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games. </p>
        <p>
         HTML and CSS are used to design the skeleton of the application, but JavaScript makes it dynamic.   
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand it more clearly, let's compare a web application with a human body. Like in the human body there is a skeleton, muscle, and nervous system, similarly, in a web application, there is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML works as a skeleton, the CSS as the muscular system, and JavaScript as the nervous system. 
        </p>
        <h2>Basic commands and functions of JavaScript.</h2>

        <h3>1. var and const</h3>

        <p><strong>var</strong> and <strong> const </strong> both are used to declare javascript variables. The difference is just that var is for a normal variable declaration whose value can be changed, whereas a variable value declared using the const keyword cannot be changed.</p>
        
        <h3>2. alert and prompt</h3>
        <p><strong>Alert</strong>: An alert is a popup that has a notice within it.</p>

           <p><strong>Prompt</strong>: A prompt has an input field and expects the user to interact with it by entering some data.</p>

        <h3>3. Console.log()</h3>
        <p>The <strong>console.log()</strong> is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.</p>

        <h3>4. readlinesync()</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Readline</strong> module provides a way of reading a datastream, one line at a time. <strong>Synchronous Readline</strong> is used for interactively running to have a conversation with the user via a console.
        </p>
        <p>
            readlineSync tries to let your script have a conversation with the user via a console, even when the input/output stream is redirected.
        </p>

        <h3>5. document.queryselector()
        </h3>

        <p>
            The<strong> Document method querySelector()</strong>  returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get the DOM elements, which have an attribute starting with a specific value, pass the following selector to the querySelectorAll method - <strong>'[title^="box"]'</strong>. The selector matches all of the DOM elements that have a *title* attribute that starts with the string *box*.
        </p>

        <h3>6. addEventListener()</h3>

        <p>
            The <strong>addEventListener() </strong> is an inbuilt function in JavaScript that takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers. 
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            After understanding these commands, you will be capable of building your very first application using javascript.
            <p>
                The more you practice, the better you will get at it. So don't give up even when you think you can't do it.
